## Analysis of Air Quality in Richmond, CA

The city of Richmond, CA, just seven miles from Berkeley, is home to the Chevron Oil Refinery. Although the refinery is the city's largest employer, the negative environmental ramifications from operation far outweigh the economic benefit of providing jobs. The escape of particulates and a litany of other chemical species from intense industrial process is leading to increased incidences of asthma
(http://richmondconfidential.org/2015/12/10/chevrons-role-in-childhood-asthma-hazy/). Therefore, the goal of this project is to analyze, employing the questions below, to gain a better understanding of the air quality of Richmond, CA. 

In order to answer the questions (see questions below) we are seeking, we need to gather data documenting incidence of asthma on an annual basis, as well as air quality (i.e. 2.5 PM or 10 PM, etc.) measurements, also on an annual basis in Richmond, CA. Moreover, using air quality measures with geographic indicators (i.e. Lat/Long) we will be able to analyze the spatial distribution of refinery operation. Ideally our research would include the air quality of Richmond before the refinery began operation, but having been commissioned since 1902, we will use Berkeley air quality data as a reference. With these three data sets we will be able to employ data science techniques that we have learned in class (mainly data sorting and visualization) to answer our questions.

In order to know what to sort, organize, and generally accomplish our mission we have three questions that will guide our project:

- How does air quality in Richmond compare to air quality in Berkeley (we will pinpoint a metric to best fit the data)?
- Is there correlation, and potentially causation, between the elevated levels of air pollution to increasing asthma rates?
- Lastly, a visualization (color gradient) of pollution will be generated on a map of Richmond, to analyze if neighborhoods in close proximity to the refinery experience higher concentrations of pollution.

Data will be obtained from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, as well as Berkeley??s data database (https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/).
